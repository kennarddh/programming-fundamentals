# Algorithms

Algorithms is a sequence of process that we can apply to solve a certain problem. To solve a same problem, there could be many possible ways to solve it. But every algorithms that can solve the same problem have their own uniqueness, time, and the amount of memory they use to solve a problem. There is a mathematical model that we can use to quantify the amount of time and memory used in solving a problem. It's call Asymtotic Notation.

Why we quantify the process?
- We can understand the amount of time needed to solve a certain problem in a bigger scale.
- We can compute the amount of memory and resources that are needed to execute the algorithm.

There are three notation used to help us quantify this:
1. Big O Notation
   Represents the worst case complexity of the algorithm.
2. Omega Notation
   Represents the best case complexity of the algorithm.
3. Theta Notation
   Represents the average case complexity of the algorithm.
