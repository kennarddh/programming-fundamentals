# Searching

Basic searching algorithms:
1. Linear Search
2. Binary Search

### Linear Search

Linear search is a searching approach where we iterate over the list and apply the rules to find something. The sequence of the data is not important.


### Binary Search

The data in the list / array should be in ascending mode or descending.
We don't need to search through all elements inside the array, but instead we can just search the part that has a possibility of the number that we want to find exist.
